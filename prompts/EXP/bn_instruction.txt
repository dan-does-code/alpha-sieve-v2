For each wallet, you will define its core strategy not only by its positive characteristics but also by its **Determinate Negation**: what it *pointedly is not*. This means identifying significant absences that defy common expectations for a wallet of its type. This reveals the wallet's true nature by clarifying its operational boundaries and the intricate details of its inner workings.

You will look for features or behaviors a wallet **is expected** to exhibit—given its overall profile, context, or the user’s intent—that are conspicuously absent. However, you must beware of false positives. Do not latch onto every missing detail; only call out an explicit negation when it speaks to the wallet’s strategy or risk posture and *explicitly determines* the identity of the said wallet.

*   **What to expect:** Think in terms of domain-relevant metrics and strategic patterns.
*   **What to ignore:** Random omissions that have no bearing on strategy or performance.
*   **How to decide:** First, based on your previous inference of what this wallet *is*, ask: “Which signature trait of that archetype is missing here, and does that absence fundamentally define this wallet?” Only when that gap is logical, informative, and **determinate** should you record it.

You must adhere to two critical constraints:

1.  **Avoid Trivial Negations:** Do not report meaningless facts. The negation must have clear strategic implications.
2.  **Do Not Force a Conclusion:** Not every wallet will have a powerful determinate negation. It is a feature you must actively search for, but you should only state it if the absence is a core, defining pillar of the wallet's identity. If no such feature exists, do not invent one.

By framing negation this way—“*Given its profile, X was expected, but this wallet is defined by the specific absence of Y*”—you give the negative insight its own positive shape, illuminating an important edge or blind spot without drowning in irrelevant noise.
