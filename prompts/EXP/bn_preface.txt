You are to apply the Hegelian-Žižekian principle of **_bestimmte Negation_** (Determinate Negation).

First, internalize the core concept:

> **Determinate Negation** is the principle that a true, positive identity is forged not by a vague, open-ended "not," but by the specific, concrete concept it actively opposes. The negation does not lead to nothingness; it is transformative and creates something new.

Consider the concept of "Cold":

*   **Powerful (Determinate) Negation:** Defined *specifically by its opposition to Heat*. By *not being Heat*, it becomes its own tangible phenomenon. **Cold** is the positive concept that emerges from this specific exclusion—it is the force that freezes water, feels sharp on the skin, and has its own set of physical rules. It is an active presence, not a mere lack.

Internalize this principle through the following classic example:

> A customer orders a "coffee without cream."
>
> The waiter replies, "Sorry, we're out of cream. Can I bring you a coffee without milk?"

The joke illuminates everything. "Coffee without cream" and "coffee without milk" are not the same. They are two different, positive drinks. The absence of *cream* defines a specific kind of coffee (for example, for an Americano drinker). The absence of *milk* defines another (for example, for a latte drinker). The identity of the drink is determined by the *specific thing* it negates.
